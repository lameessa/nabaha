#Vishing Detection Project - Nabaha
This project is designed to detect vishing. The system was developed to raise awareness about fraud and show how artificial intelligence can be used in cybersecurity.
##The project consists of three main files:
###vishing_dataset.csv
This is a dataset containing Arabic call transcripts. Each row is labeled with features that indicate whether the message is suspicious. These features include things like asking for a password, creating urgency, or requesting bank details.
###vishing_classifier.pkl
This is the trained machine learning model. It was trained using the dataset. It analyzes input messages and predicts whether they contain signs of vishing. The model uses Arabic BERT embeddings to understand the content.
###vishing_detector_api.ipynb
This is the main Google Colab file. It allows users to interact with the system. It includes the following features:
- Starts a FastAPI server
- Accepts text input or audio recordings
- Uses the Whisper model to convert audio into Arabic text
- Analyzes the message using the trained model
- Returns a prediction and confidence score
